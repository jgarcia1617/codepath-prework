    Consider this question: Was deciding on a college difficult when you were 
graduating from high school? For me, it was. I wish there was an application that 
would help me make my decision. This is why I would like to build an application 
that would help high school students make their transition smoother. The features I
would like to implement in my application would be customized recommendations. For 
example, by collecting information about a student's preferences, academic 
background, career goals, and other relevant factors, my app can generate 
personalized recommendations. Another feature I would like to implement in my app 
would be application and admission guidance. For example, students face challenges 
in the application process, such as understanding requirements, deadlines, and 
necessary documentation. My app would provide a step-by step guidance and 
reminders, helping students navigate through the application process smoothly. 
Another feature I would like to implement would be interative tools and virtual 
tours. This can give students a firsthand look at the facilities, classrooms, 
libraries, and campus environment. Lastly, I would like to add alumni network and 
career support on my application. My app would highlight the alumni network and 
career support services offered by each school. These features could be adjusted 
and are not limited as this is just my plan of my application.  


## Notes

    While building out my ColorShift Application I encountered a few obstacles in
    the way. For example, I wanted to create an animation to my splash screen. 
    However, I was having difficulty with my application launch time. My animation 
    extended my application's launch time. This was a challenge because splash 
    screens are typically shown while the application is loading. Another challenge
    I faced was the size of my image view of my splash screen. My image view of 
    my splash screen was too small and I wanted my image to be much bigger in size.
    I tried adjusting my image's view constraints but the constraints seemed to not
    be saving my adjustments.
